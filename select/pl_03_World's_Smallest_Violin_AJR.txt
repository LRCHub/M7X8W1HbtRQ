Boy this ain't therapy
Don't come here crying
Words don't mean shit to me
When it's all lying
Sing your heartbreak symphony
While I play the world's smallest violin
While I play the world's smallest violin
Oh man another one bites the dust
Another shot to my trust
Another point down for love
But goddamn
20-inch heels, I'm up
Thinking how low I got
The mountain I had to jump
Ain't falling again
So show up bright out of the blue
That's your decision
If that's what you just gotta do
See what you're missing
I'm up here like what would Jesus do
Forget him forgive him
Watch me dance
Lost your chance
Now I won't hold your hand
Boy this ain't therapy
Don't come here crying
Words don't mean shit to me
When it's all lying
Sing your heartbreak symphony
While I play the world's smallest violin
While I play the world's smallest violin
While I play the world's smallest violin
Boohoo another tear down your face
Another blah blah blah I'll change
Another boy tryna play
But ooh ooh
Cry a river cry a lake
I wouldn't care either way
I'm burning your shit with sage
So show up bright out of the blue
That's your decision
If that's what you just gotta do
See what you're missing
I'm up here like what would Jesus do
Forget him forgive him
Watch me dance
Lost your chance
Now I won't hold your hand
Boy this ain't therapy
Don't come here crying
Words don't mean shit to me
When it's all lying
Sing your heartbreak symphony
While I play the world's smallest violin
While I play the world's smallest violin
While I play the world's smallest violin
